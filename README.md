In this project I have created a new full website with features including users/log-in, basket, payment methods and order history.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For this project you need:

```
Nodejs
```

### Installing

Go to brite-U-eCommerce-project/server and run:

```
npm install
```

Now you can run the server. You can use any port but remember that later we will run react in port 3000. For example, run:

```
PORT=5000 nodemon index.js
```

Now you can go to brite-U-eCommerce-project/client and install all the react dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Running React

In the folder brite-U-eCommerce-project/client/src run:

```
npm start
```

Now you can see Brite-U web!
